## Welcome to SolidBench

SolidBench is a developer's playground to experiment with various aspects of the Solid ecosystem.
It features f.i. a pod browser with advanced editing and viewing capabilities, a type scanner, and several domain-specific
applications.

For a full experience, log in with your choice of a Solid provider. 

You can also check out the domain specific functionalities without logging in, 
with these various samples : 
 - [Music playlist](./samples/music/playlist-1.ttl)
 - [Retail receipt](./samples/retail/receipts-1.ttl)
 - [Annotations](./samples/annotations/annotations-1.ttl)

Certain functionalities (in particular HTML annotations) require the installation of a browser extension
that is not yet published in official app stores, but can be downloaded and installed manually from https://test.solidbench.dev/solid-annotations-extension.zip
